This app is a prototype of Pottho app. As it is not fully implemented,
there are a lot of incomplete features. 
 
Usage: 
1. Give some phone number, click get verification code. 
2. Then type any code and click verify. The verification system is not
yet implemented. However, you can log in using phone number 123456789 and code 222222 and register using any number with code 111111. 
 
Rest of the app should be intuitive. 
###Known Issues: 
Clicking verify without clicking 'get verification code' causes the app to crash, probably due to null pointer exception. 
 
 
To be implemented: 
1. Mobile number verification system 
2. Online payment system 
3. A server side database to keep records of transactions 
4. A proper bill issuing system. (The prototype bills everyone 890 regardless of his/her purchase).
